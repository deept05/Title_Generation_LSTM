- NumPy
- pandas
- TensorFlow

# Usage

## Data Preprocessing

The `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook is designed to prepare the raw data for training the LSTM model. This involves several key steps:

- **Raw Data Handling:** The notebook begins by loading raw text data, which may come in various formats such as CSV or JSON.
- **Tokenization:** Text data is split into individual tokens (words or subwords) to convert it into a format suitable for modeling. Tokenization helps in converting text into numerical representations that the LSTM model can understand.
- **Padding:** Sequences of tokens are padded to ensure uniform length across all data inputs. This step is crucial because LSTM models require fixed-length input sequences for training and inference.
- **Data Splitting:** The notebook also typically includes steps to split the data into training, validation, and test sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

## Model Training

The `model_training.ipynb` notebook focuses on building and training the LSTM model. Key aspects include:

- **Model Architecture:** The notebook defines the LSTM architecture, including the number of layers, units per layer, and activation functions. This setup is crucial for capturing the temporal dependencies in text data.
- **Training Process:** The model is trained using the preprocessed data. The notebook configures the training process, including setting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs.
- **Optimization:** During training, various optimization techniques and loss functions are used to adjust the model parameters and improve performance. The notebook tracks metrics such as loss and accuracy to monitor progress.
- **Validation:** The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to ensure it generalizes well to unseen data, avoiding overfitting.

## Title Generation

The `title_generation.ipynb` notebook is used for generating titles based on the trained LSTM model. This involves:

- **Loading the Trained Model:** The notebook loads the pre-trained LSTM model that has been trained on the processed data.
- **Generating Titles:** By providing a seed text (an initial prompt), the model predicts the subsequent words to generate coherent titles. This step uses the model's ability to understand and generate sequences based on learned patterns.
- **Output Evaluation:** The generated titles are evaluated for relevance and coherence. The notebook may include visualizations or comparisons to assess the quality of the generated titles.



# Results
- The model generates coherent and contextually appropriate titles for various text inputs. The performance of the model is visualized through training and validation loss plots.
